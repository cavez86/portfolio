NOTE: The bun.lockb file needs to be generated on a system where Bun can run properly.

To generate it:
1. Install Bun: curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
2. Run: bun install
3. Commit the generated bun.lockb file

This file could not be generated in the current CI environment due to platform-specific limitations,
but will be created automatically when the first developer or CI system runs 'bun install' successfully.
